Concept of PASTAS
=================
A time-series model consists of one or more StressModels which together with a Constant and a NoiseModel form the simulation.
Most StressModels use a response-function, from the rfunc-module, that transform the stress in its contribution in the simulation.
Examples of response-functions are Gamma, Exponential or One (which is used for the Constant).
Each StressModel has a number of parameters, which are optimized by the Solver.
During optimization the innovations (or the residuals, the difference from the observations, when no NoiseModel is used) are minimized.
